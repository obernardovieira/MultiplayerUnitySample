# MultiplayerUnitySample
This is only and example built following this [tutorial][tutorialwebpage]. I also used this to give a try to Unity Cloud Build.

## Usage:
To run this example, execute one has a standalone application and also run in editor (or run two standalone applications or more if you want to)<br/>
One of them needs to be the "LAN Host" and the others the "LAN Client".<br/>
That's all. This is only an example.<br/>
